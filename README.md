# ElectricalEthereum

An automated electrical grid.
Powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, which is controlled by a hybrid smart contract using Chainlink Keepers to automate turning off LEDs for electrical bill expirations. 

Hardware: 

-Raspberry Pi 4 [Quantity: 1]

-LED (Red) [Quantity: 1]

-330 ohm resistor [Quantity: 1]

The LED is used to show a connection is powered while the 330 ohm resistor limits current (divides voltage away from LED which exponetinally increases current).

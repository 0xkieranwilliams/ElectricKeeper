# ElectricalEthereum

An automated electrical grid powered by a hybrid smart contract using Chainlink Keepers. 

Hardware: 
-Raspberry Pi 4 [Quantity: 1]

-LED (Red) [Quantity: 1]

-330 ohm resistor [Quantity: 1]

The LED is used to show a connection is powered while the 330 ohm resistor limits current (divides voltage away from LED which exponetinally increases current).

# ETH DENVER 2022 Project Name Ideas: KeepElectric, ElectricKeepers, ElectricalEthereum 

An automated electrical grid.
Powered by a Raspberry Pi 4, which is controlled by a hybrid smart contract using Chainlink Keepers to automate turning off LEDs for electric bill expirations.

Hardware: 

-Raspberry Pi 4 [Quantity: 1]

-LED (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) [Quantity: 1 each]

-330 ohm resistor [Quantity: 4]

The LED is used to show a connection is powered while the 330 ohm resistor in series with the LED limits current (divides voltage away from LED which exponetinally increases current).
